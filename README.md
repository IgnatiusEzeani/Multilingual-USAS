Lexicons for the Multilingual UCREL Semantic Analysis System 

The UCREL semantic analysis system (USAS) is a framework for undertaking 
the automatic semantic analysis of text. The framework has been designed 
and used across a number of research projects since 1990.

The USAS framework initially in English is being extended to other languages.
This repository houses the lexicons and tagsets for the non-English versions
of the USAS tagger.

In order to reference this further development of the multilingual USAS 
tagger, please cite our paper at NAACL-HLT 2015, which described our bootstrapping approach:

In 2016, we extended this initial approach to twelve languages and evaluated the 
coverage of these lexicons on multilingual corpora. Please cite our LREC-2016 paper:
