## Introduction

The UCREL semantic analysis system (USAS) is a framework for undertaking the automatic semantic analysis of text. The framework has been designed and used across a number of research projects since 1990.

The USAS framework initially in English is being extended to other languages. **This repository houses the lexicons and tagsets for the non-English versions of the USAS tagger.**


For more details about the USAS tagger, see our website: [http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/](http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/usas/). Others collaborating on multilingual lexicon development are listed on this site.


## Lexicon File Format

All lexicon files are `tsv` formatted. There are two main type of file formats the **single word** and the **multi word expression (MWE)** lexicons. These two file formats can be easily distinguished in two ways:

1. The **MWE** files will always have the word **mwe** within the file name e.g. the Welsh MWE lexicon file name is called `mwe-welsh.tsv` and can be found at [./Welsh/mwe-welsh.tsv](./Welsh/mwe-welsh.tsv). Where as the **single word** lexicon files will never have the word **mwe** within it's file name.
2. The **MWE** files compared to the **single** word would typically only contain 2 headers:
    * `mwe_template`
    * `semantic_tags`

### Single word lexicon file format

These lexicons on each line will contain at minimum a lemma and a list of semantic tags associated to that lemma in rank order, whereby the most likely semantic tag is the first tag in white space separated list, an example of a line can be seen below:

``` tsv
Austin	Z1 Z2
```

In the example above we can see that for the lemma `Austin` the most likely semantic tag is `Z1`.

A full list of valid TSV headers and their expected value:

| Header name | Required | Value | Example |
| ------------|----------|-------|---------|
| `lemma`     | :heavy_check_mark: | The base/dictionary form of the `token`. See [Manning, Raghavan, and Sch√ºtze IR book for more details on lemmatization.](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html) | `car` |
| `semantic_tags` | :heavy_check_mark: | A list of semantic/USAS tags seperated by whitespace, whereby the most likely semantic tag is the first tag in the list.| `Z0 Z3` |
| `pos` | :x: | Part Of Speech (POS) tag associated with the `lemma` and `token`. | `Noun` |
| `token` | :x: | The full word/token form of the `lemma`. | `cars` |

Example single word lexicon file:

``` tsv
lemma	token	pos	semantic_tags
Austin	Austin	Noun	Z1 Z2
car	cars	Noun	Z0 Z3
```

### Multi Word Expression (MWE) lexicon file format

In 2015/16, we extended this initial approach to twelve languages and evaluated the coverage of these lexicons on multilingual corpora. Please cite our [LREC-2016 paper](https://aclanthology.org/L16-1416/):
